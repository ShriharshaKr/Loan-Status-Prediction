# Loan_status_prediction
To predict the Loan status and impact of the incident raised by the customer.

# Skewnwess :
To make the distribution or skewness normal, we can remove outliers or can apply different transformations (eg. log, square, etc..).

# EDA :
In EDA, analysis has been done on each feature to get an idea about how it has an impact on the target variable.

# Feature Engineering :
In the FE part, we made few new features like TotalIncome, EMI, and Capacity to get the relevant ideas to predict loan status considering an interest rate of 7.5 %.

# Model Building :
In this project, model building has been done using 10 different algorithms 
1) Logistic Regression
2) Decision Tree
3) Random Forest
4) Xtreme Gradient Boosting
5) Bagging Classifier
6) Stochastic Gradient Descent
7) k-means Clustering
8) Support Vector Machine
9) Multi Nomial Naive Bayes
10) Extra Tree Classifier

# Model Evaluation :
After applying the above algorithms, we got an accuracy of 79.16 % while checked on Analytics Vidhya's Loan status prediction project.
